<h1 align="center"><b>Hi , I'm block pirate </b><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="35"></h1>

I am a blockchain enthusiast with over 7 years of experience. My expertise encompasses decentralized exchanges, perpetual futures, relayers, order books, and core blockchain technologies. I have successfully deployed multiple smart contracts on both layer one and layer two blockchains. Additionally, I have worked extensively with golang in various fields like Cosmos SDK, P2P implementations, developed event watchers and workers to interact with smart contracts.

In my career, I have created highly scalable backend architectures and managed databases effectively. I have built projects using a modular microservice architecture in Golang, optimizing database interactions and models. My strong foundation in blockchain empowers me to provide solutions for scalable design implementation and the critical thinking necessary for robust product architecture.

I thrive on taking ownership of projects and collaborating with teams to maximize contributions. Passionate about open source, I actively engage with the community. Committed to staying at the forefront of the field, I am dedicated to continuous learning and growth.
